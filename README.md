### THIRD-PARTY REQUIREMENTS ###

1.  The web link testing process rely on an external application called Automation Anywhere (http://http://www.automationanywhere.com).  The easiest way to install Automation Anywhere on a Windows computer is to download the software from http://http://www.automationanywhere.com/download/freeTrial.htm.

2.  Copy both script files into the folder: "My Documents\Automation Anywhere\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks".  For example: "C:\Users\Photoshop\Documents\Automation Anywhere Files\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks"

A)  Find_Broken_Links_In_Website.atmx
 
B)  Find_Broken_Links_In_Website.atmr

You will be able to see the saved script in the Automation Anywhere's task pane.  Now you can run the ACL script to call the script in Automation Anywhere to perform the web link testing.
